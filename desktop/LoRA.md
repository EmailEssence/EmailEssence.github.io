# LoRA Fine-Tuning for Local Email Summarization

This document outlines the process for implementing a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned model to perform email summarization locally within our desktop Electron application.

## Objectives

- Create a performant model that runs efficiently on low-compute machines
- Match summary quality of cloud AI APIs (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Output JSON responses compatible with our existing schema
- Eliminate dependency on cloud services for basic summarization

## Task List

### 1. Model Selection & Environment Setup

- [ ] Select appropriate base model (consider Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, or Phi-3-mini)
- [ ] Set up development environment for fine-tuning
  - [ ] Configure PyTorch with appropriate CUDA version if using GPU
  - [ ] Install required libraries (PEFT, transformers, bitsandbytes for quantization)
- [ ] Create model evaluation framework to compare with existing solutions

### 2. Dataset Preparation

- [ ] Create synthetic email dataset for fine-tuning
  - [ ] Generate diverse email templates with varying complexity
  - [ ] Ensure dataset covers different email types (notifications, requests, etc.)
- [ ] Format dataset to match input/output patterns from our existing system
  - [ ] Structure input as formatted email content
  - [ ] Structure output as JSON with summary and keywords fields
- [ ] Split into training, validation, and test sets

### 3. LoRA Fine-Tuning Implementation

- [ ] Configure LoRA hyperparameters
  - [ ] Determine appropriate rank (r) for efficiency/performance balance
  - [ ] Set alpha parameter and dropout values
  - [ ] Select appropriate target modules for adaptation
- [ ] Implement training loop with effective batch size for available hardware
- [ ] Apply quantization techniques (4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce memory requirements
- [ ] Monitor and adjust learning rate
- [ ] Implement early stopping based on validation metrics

### 4. Model Optimization for Desktop Deployment

- [ ] Quantize model for inference (GGUF/GGML format)
- [ ] Implement model pruning techniques if needed
- [ ] Benchmark performance across target hardware configurations
- [ ] Optimize prompt templates for local inference
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for complex emails

### 5. Integration with Electron Application

- [ ] Create a `LocalModelBackend` class implementing the `ModelBackend` protocol
- [ ] Design `LocalEmailSummarizer` class extending `AdaptiveSummarizer`
- [ ] Implement proper model loading/unloading to manage memory usage
- [ ] Add configuration options for model parameters
- [ ] Create prompts optimized for local inference

### 6. Implementation Details

- [ ] Create desktop/app/services/summarization/providers/local/ directory structure
- [ ] Implement the following files:
  - [ ] local.py (containing LocalModelBackend and LocalEmailSummarizer)
  - [ ] prompts.py (for local model prompt management)
  - [ ] config.py (for model configuration options)
- [ ] Update __init__.py files to expose the new provider

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Create unit tests for local model integration
- [ ] Develop benchmarking suite to compare performance with API versions
- [ ] Test on minimum spec hardware to verify performance
- [ ] Validate JSON output format compatibility with existing schema
- [ ] Create automated evaluation pipeline for summary quality

### 8. Deployment & Distribution

- [ ] Package model with application or implement download-on-demand
- [ ] Set up model versioning system for future updates
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms to cloud APIs when necessary
- [ ] Implement telemetry for model performance (with user opt-in)
- [ ] Document user-facing model configuration options

## Technical Considerations

- The model must conform to our existing `SummarySchema` format
- Target response format: 
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "Concise single-sentence summary",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
  }
  ```
- The model should be capable of running on machines with limited GPU capabilities
- Memory usage should be optimized for desktop environments
- Consider hybrid approaches that could use local models for simple emails and API for complex ones
